# 💻 Laptop Buying Prediction – Machine Learning Classification Project

This project focuses on predicting whether a user will **buy a laptop or not**, based on various demographic and behavioral features.  
It is an end-to-end Machine Learning classification project that includes **data cleaning, EDA, preprocessing, model building, comparison, and evaluation**.

---

## 🚀 Project Objectives
- Build a classification model to predict laptop purchase decisions.
- Understand which customer attributes influence buying behavior.
- Perform complete ML workflow:  
  **EDA → Preprocessing → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Evaluation**
- Compare multiple algorithms and choose the best-performing model.

## 🧠 Features Used
Typical features used in this dataset (customizable):

- Age  
- Gender  
- Occupation  
- Annual Income  
- City Tier  
- Product Price  
- Brand Value  
- RAM, Storage Preferences  
- Past Purchase History  
- Online Activity Level  
- Discount Viewed  
- **Target Variable:** `Bought_Laptop (Yes/No)`

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA includes:
- Missing value analysis  
- Outlier detection  
- Distribution plots  
- Purchase trend analysis  
- Correlation heatmap  
- Feature importance analysis  

Key insights were extracted to understand customer purchase behavior.

## 🧼 Data Preprocessing
Performed the following steps:

- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Scaling numerical features  
- Handling imbalance (SMOTE if required)  
- Train-test split

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
The following models were trained and compared:

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Gradient Boosting / XGBoost *(optional)*  

Evaluation metrics:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  
- Confusion matrix  

**Best model:** *Random Forest / SVM (depends on your results)*

## 📊 Results & Conclusion
- Achieved an accuracy of **XX%** (replace with your actual score).  
- Identified top features influencing decision such as:
  - Price  
  - Income Level  
  - Brand Preference  
  - RAM/Storage  

The model can help businesses predict customer interest and improve targeted marketing.
